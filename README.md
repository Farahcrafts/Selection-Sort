# Selection-Sort

This project implements the **Selection Sort** algorithm in **C** using a **singly linked list**. The program creates a linked list of integers, sorts the list using the selection sort algorithm, and displays the sorted list.

## How It Works

1. **Create a linked list**: The program allows you to insert integer values into a singly linked list.
2. **Sort the list**: The **Selection Sort** algorithm is applied to the linked list to sort the values in ascending order.
3. **Display the sorted list**: Once the sorting is complete, the program prints out the sorted linked list.
4. **Memory cleanup**: After sorting and displaying the list, the program frees the memory allocated to the list nodes.
